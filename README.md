# KVortex: High-Performance Distributed Key-Value Store

![KVortex Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimathikim/KVortex/refs/heads/main/kvotex.webp)

KVortex is a **distributed key-value store** built in Go, designed for **scalability, fault tolerance, and high performance**. It leverages Go's concurrency model and modern distributed systems principles to provide a reliable and efficient storage solution for modern applications.

---

## Overview

KVortex is a distributed key-value store that allows you to store, retrieve, and manage data across multiple nodes. It is designed to handle large-scale workloads while ensuring **high availability** and **low latency**. Whether you're building a microservices architecture, a caching layer, or a distributed database, KVortex provides the tools you need to scale effortlessly.

### Goals:
- Provide a **scalable and fault-tolerant** key-value storage solution.
- Simplify distributed systems development with an easy-to-use API.
- Demonstrate the power of Go in building high-performance systems.

---

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture:** Data is sharded across multiple nodes for scalability.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic replication ensures data availability even during node failures.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for low-latency reads and writes.
- **Consistent Hashing:** Ensures even distribution of data across nodes.
- **RESTful API:** Easy-to-use HTTP API for interacting with the system.
- **Monitoring Dashboard:** Real-time insights into cluster health and performance.
- **Extensible Storage Backends:** Supports in-memory, file-based, and SQLite storage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Go 1.20 or higher.
- Git.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KVortex.git
   cd KVortex
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o kvortex .
   ```

4. Run KVortex:
   ```bash
   ./kvortex --config config.yaml
   ```

5. Access the monitoring dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Usage

### Starting a Node:
To start a KVortex node, use the following command:
```bash
./kvortex --config config.yaml
```

### Example `config.yaml`:
```yaml
node_id: "node1"
address: "localhost:8080"
storage_backend: "memory"
replication_factor: 3
```

### Using the RESTful API:
- **Set a Key-Value Pair:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/set -d '{"key": "foo", "value": "bar"}'
  ```

- **Get a Value by Key:**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/get?key=foo
  ```

- **Delete a Key:**
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/delete?key=foo
  ```

### Monitoring:
Access the monitoring dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard` to view cluster health, node status, and performance metrics.
